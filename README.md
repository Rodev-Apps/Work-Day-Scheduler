# Work-Day Scheduler
_A Simple Calendar Application._

## Overview
The idea is definitely a good one and it sounds like and easy assignment. However, the more I ponder over it, the trickier the solution becomes. Exactly how do you create a Workday Scheduler that the employee of any company can use to keep themselves organised. That is my task this time around and I expect by the time I’m done.
This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript and jQuery. It should have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

## Description
This is essentially a calendar application that allows a user to enter details about events for each hour of the day and save them. It consists of rows that represents the hourly blocks of a typical 9 – 5 working day of the average employee. These are colour coded to help reference past, present and future time blocks. With a save button on the right to save your entries. 

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

## Usage
This Repo is made up of the core files and folders related to the task. I have added comments to all the relevant sections of the code, highlighting key areas and the expected result derived from it. The content comprise only that related to the task and I have kept the interface very simple and straight forward to use. It also contains a folder with an animated image of the mock-up depicting the final product. It’s quite straight forward to use, simply click here to begin.
